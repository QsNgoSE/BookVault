# üìã BookVault Deployment Checklist - Streamlined 2-Service Architecture

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Setup
- [ ] GitHub repository created and code pushed
- [ ] Railway account created and CLI installed
- [ ] Local development environment working
- [ ] Both services build successfully locally

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

**Streamlined 2-Service Design:**
- **Auth Service** (Port 8082): Authentication + User Management + Admin Operations
- **Book Service** (Port 8083): Books + Categories + Reviews + **Orders + Shopping Cart**

## üöÄ Railway Backend Deployment

### Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Railway project created: `railway new bookvault-production`
- [ ] PostgreSQL database added: `railway add postgresql`
- [ ] Redis cache added: `railway add redis`
- [ ] Database connection tested

### Auth Service Deployment
- [ ] Auth service created: `railway service create auth-service`
- [ ] Auth service deployed: `railway up --service auth-service`
- [ ] Environment variables configured:
  - [ ] `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway`
  - [ ] `JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-here`
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` (auto-configured)
  - [ ] `REDIS_URL=redis://...` (auto-configured)
- [ ] Service health check passed
- [ ] Auth endpoints tested:
  - [ ] POST `/api/auth/register`
  - [ ] POST `/api/auth/login`
  - [ ] GET `/api/auth/profile/{userId}`

### Book Service Deployment (Including Orders)
- [ ] Book service created: `railway service create book-service`
- [ ] Book service deployed: `railway up --service book-service`
- [ ] Environment variables configured:
  - [ ] `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=railway`
  - [ ] `JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret-key-here` (same as auth)
  - [ ] `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...` (shared database)
- [ ] Service health check passed
- [ ] Book endpoints tested:
  - [ ] GET `/api/books`
  - [ ] GET `/api/books/{id}`
  - [ ] GET `/api/categories`
- [ ] **Order endpoints tested:**
  - [ ] POST `/api/orders`
  - [ ] GET `/api/orders/my-orders`
  - [ ] PUT `/api/orders/{id}/cancel`

### Service URLs Documentation
- [ ] Auth Service URL: `https://auth-service-xxx.railway.app`
- [ ] Book Service URL: `https://book-service-xxx.railway.app`

## üåê Frontend GitHub Pages Deployment

### Repository Setup
- [ ] Frontend repository ready for GitHub Pages
- [ ] `config.js` updated with Railway service URLs
- [ ] All frontend files in root or docs folder

### GitHub Pages Configuration
- [ ] Repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Pages
- [ ] Source: Deploy from branch
- [ ] Branch: main, Folder: / (root)
- [ ] Custom domain configured (optional)

### Frontend Configuration Update
```javascript
// config.js - Update these URLs after Railway deployment
const BookVaultConfig = {
    production: {
        AUTH_SERVICE_URL: 'https://your-auth-service.railway.app/api',
        BOOK_SERVICE_URL: 'https://your-book-service.railway.app/api',
        ORDER_SERVICE_URL: 'https://your-book-service.railway.app/api', // Same as book service
    }
}
```

## üîß Post-Deployment Testing

### Authentication Flow
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] JWT token validation works
- [ ] User profile updates work
- [ ] Admin panel accessible

### Book Management
- [ ] Book catalog loads
- [ ] Book search works
- [ ] Book details display
- [ ] Categories filter properly

### **Order Management (New!)**
- [ ] Shopping cart functionality
- [ ] Order creation works
- [ ] Order history displays
- [ ] Order status updates work
- [ ] Order cancellation works
- [ ] Stock management works (inventory decreases)

### Admin Functions
- [ ] User management works
- [ ] Book management works
- [ ] **Order management works**
- [ ] **Order status updates work**
- [ ] **Order tracking works**

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- [ ] **Database tables created**: Both auth and book services share one database
- [ ] **JWT secret consistency**: Same secret across both services
- [ ] **CORS enabled**: Both services can be called from frontend
- [ ] **Order tables created**: New order tables exist in shared database

### Database Schema Check
```sql
-- Verify all tables exist:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- Should include:
-- users, books, categories, book_categories, book_reviews
-- orders, order_items (NEW)
```

## üìä Service Architecture Summary

### Auth Service Responsibilities:
- ‚úÖ User authentication (register, login, JWT)
- ‚úÖ User profile management
- ‚úÖ Admin user management
- ‚úÖ Login attempt tracking
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control

### Book Service Responsibilities:
- ‚úÖ Book catalog management
- ‚úÖ Category management
- ‚úÖ Book reviews
- ‚úÖ **Order processing** (NEW)
- ‚úÖ **Shopping cart** (NEW)
- ‚úÖ **Order tracking** (NEW)
- ‚úÖ **Inventory management** (NEW)

## üí∞ Cost Optimization Benefits

**2-Service Architecture Advantages:**
- **50% fewer Railway services** = Lower monthly costs
- **Shared database** = Single PostgreSQL instance
- **Simplified deployment** = Easier maintenance
- **Better performance** = Fewer network calls between services
- **Complete functionality** = All features preserved

## üîÑ Deployment Commands Summary

```bash
# 1. Infrastructure
railway new bookvault-production
railway add postgresql redis

# 2. Auth Service
railway service create auth-service
cd backend/auth-service
railway up --service auth-service

# 3. Book Service (with Orders)
railway service create book-service  
cd backend/book-service
railway up --service book-service

# 4. Update Frontend URLs and deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## ‚úÖ Final Checklist
- [ ] Both services deployed and healthy
- [ ] Database tables created
- [ ] Frontend updated with correct URLs
- [ ] All core functionality tested
- [ ] **Order functionality tested**
- [ ] Production environment ready
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Documentation updated
