## üîÑ Backend Integration Notes

### Seller API Endpoints:
The seller functionality relies on these backend endpoints being properly authenticated:
- `DELETE /books/{id}` - Book deletion
- `PUT /books/{id}` - Book updates
- `GET /books/seller/{sellerId}` - Seller's books

### Authentication Issues:
If you encounter 403 Forbidden errors for seller operations, check:
1. JWT token is properly included in requests
2. Backend `.authenticated()` middleware is correctly configured
3. Seller role verification in backend endpoints

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### Test User Roles:
1. **Login as USER** - Should access user.html, can purchase books
2. **Login as SELLER** - Should access seller.html, cannot purchase books
3. **Login as ADMIN** - Should access admin.html, cannot purchase books

### Test Functionality:
1. **Avatar Changes** - Change avatar in user profile, verify persistence
2. **Wishlist** - Add/remove books, verify dashboard updates
3. **Admin Management** - Edit users, change roles, manage books
4. **Seller Management** - Edit/delete books, view analytics
5. **Product Restrictions** - Verify sellers cannot see cart/purchase buttons

## üìã Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Backend authentication endpoints working
- [ ] Seller API endpoints properly authenticated
- [ ] Role-based redirections working

## üí° Notes

- All changes are backward compatible
- Avatar system uses localStorage until database integration

The application now properly handles role-based access control, seller purchase restrictions, avatar management, wishlist functionality, enhanced admin capabilities, and proper navigation restrictions. Only backend authorization updates are needed for complete admin book management.**
