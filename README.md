# BookVault – Modern Online Book Marketplace

BookVault is a scalable, modern web application for discovering, buying, selling, and managing books.  
It’s built with a robust **microservices backend (Java/Spring Boot)** and a clean, responsive **frontend** using HTML5, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript.

## Frontend

* **Stack:** HTML5, Bootstrap 5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Structure:** Modular HTML files with reusable CSS (`assets/css/bookvault.css`)
* **Responsive:** Mobile-first design; user-friendly on all devices
* **Integration Ready:** Uses AJAX/fetch (or template engines) to connect to backend APIs for live book/product/user data

---

## Backend

* **Stack:** Java 17+, Spring Boot (RESTful microservices), Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, MySQL/PostgreSQL
* **Architecture:**

  * **Microservices:**

    * User Service
    * Product/Book Service
    * Order Service
    * Auth Service
    * Notification/Support Service
    * Gateway/API Gateway
  * **Role-based security:** User, Seller, Admin
  * **REST APIs:** Used by frontend to fetch books, users, orders, reviews, etc.
  * **Scalable:** Each microservice can be deployed/scaled independently.

---

## How Frontend & Backend Work Together

* The frontend is **decoupled** and communicates with the backend via HTTP APIs (usually via `/api/*` endpoints).
* Book/product lists, user info, seller dashboards, and admin panels all pull real-time data from backend microservices.
* Actions like login, registration, uploading a book, or making a purchase call secure REST endpoints on the backend.
* All business logic, authentication, and data storage happen in the backend; the frontend handles UI/UX and client logic.

## Setup & Getting Started

### Frontend

1. **Clone or download** this repo.
2. Open `/bookvault-frontend/` in VS Code or your favorite editor.
3. Open `index.html` (or any page) in your browser to preview the UI.
4. For real data, configure the frontend to call your backend REST endpoints (update API URLs as needed).

### Backend (Java/Spring Boot Microservices)

1. Set up each Spring Boot microservice (clone from your microservices repos).
2. Configure databases and application properties.
3. Start the services (see individual service README files for instructions).
4. Ensure CORS is enabled for frontend-backend communication.

## Customization

* **Branding:** Update `/assets/img/logo/bookvault-logo.png` for your own logo.
* **Images:** Place cover and team images in `/assets/img/books/` and `/assets/img/team/`.
* **CSS:** Extend `/assets/css/bookvault.css` for custom theming.
