# BookVault Development Session Summary

## Session Overview
This session focused on fixing authentication rate limiting logic and frontend issues in the BookVault e-commerce platform, continuing from previous work that had resolved service discovery issues.

## Initial Context
The user referenced SESSION_SUMMARY.md showing BookVault as a microservices-based online book marketplace with Java/Spring Boot backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. Previous sessions had implemented wishlist functionality, purchase history with real backend integration, and resolved service discovery problems.

## Main Issues Addressed

### 1. Rate Limiting Logic Correction
The user pointed out that the rate limiting wasn't working correctly - it was banning after 4 attempts instead of 3. The specified requirements were:
- **User Login (Redis-based):** 3 attempts ‚Üí 15-minute ban, 5 attempts ‚Üí permanent database ban
- **IP Login (separate Redis key):** 5 attempts ‚Üí 30-minute IP ban

**Root Cause Identified:** The `recordUserFailedAttempt` method was deleting the attempts counter when applying temporary bans, causing the system to restart counting from 0 on subsequent attempts.

**Fix Applied:** Modified the method to check if user is already banned before incrementing attempts, and preserved the attempts counter during temporary bans to allow progression to permanent bans.

**Testing Results:** After rebuilding and restarting the auth service (PID 53694), the corrected logic worked perfectly:
- 1st attempt: Normal failed login
- 2nd attempt: Warning message
- 3rd attempt: 15-minute temporary ban applied
- 4th attempt: Ban message displayed correctly

### 2. Frontend Navigation Issues
The user identified that the logout functionality was not working despite the dropdown being visible.

**Investigation Process:**
- Confirmed logout button existed with correct classes (`dropdown-item logout-btn`)
- Found button was `Visible: false` (hidden in collapsed Bootstrap dropdown)
- Enhanced event listeners with `e.stopPropagation()` and capture phase
- Added keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+L`) as backup
- Created debug utilities (`debugAuth.findLogoutButtons()`, `debugAuth.forceLogout()`)

**Final Solution:** Implemented `forceFixLogoutButtons()` method that:
- Waits 1 second after page load for DOM stability
- Clones logout buttons to remove conflicting event listeners
- Replaces them with reliable click handlers
- Uses multiple event types (click + mousedown) as backup

### 3. Book Listing Page Loading Issues
The user reported that the book listing page wasn't loading books properly.

**API Testing:** Confirmed book service was working correctly:
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/api/books
```
Returned 10 books with proper data structure in `response.data.content`.

**Root Cause:** Frontend was trying to access `response.content` when the actual API structure was:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "content": [... books array ...],
    "page": 0,
    "totalPages": 1
  }
}
```

**Fixes Applied:**
- Changed data access from `response.content` to `response.data.content` with fallbacks
- Fixed this in `loadBooks()`, `searchBooks()`, and `loadBooksWithFilters()` methods
- Enhanced book display with proper image handling and stock status
- Added comprehensive debug logging

### 4. Book Cover Image Implementation
The user requested adding the `the-great-gatsby.png` image to the DataInitializer.

**Implementation:**
- Updated `DataInitializer.java` to support cover images
- Added overloaded `createBook()` method with `coverImageUrl` parameter
- Added `updateBookImages()` method to update existing books with missing images
- Modified "The Great Gatsby" book creation to include the image path: `"asset/img/books/the-great-gatsby.png"`

## Technical Implementations

### Backend Changes
- **LoginAttemptService.java:** Fixed ban progression logic and attempts counter preservation
- **AuthService.java:** Enhanced with proper BanInfo handling
- **GlobalExceptionHandler.java:** Ensured structured error responses
- **DataInitializer.java:** Added support for book cover images

### Frontend Changes
- **main.js:** Enhanced logout event handling, added force-fix mechanism, fixed API response parsing
- **bookvault.css:** Added smooth navigation transitions and error styling

### System Status
- ‚úÖ Discovery Service (8761): Running with all services registered
- ‚úÖ Auth Service (8082): Running with corrected rate limiting
- ‚úÖ Book Service (8083): Running with full catalog and image support
- ‚úÖ Order Service (8084): Running with purchase history integration
- ‚úÖ Frontend: Enhanced with improved book loading

## Key Commands Used
- **Unban command:** `curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/api/auth/clear-bans`
- **Service restart:** `mvn package -DskipTests -q && java -jar target/auth-service-1.0.0.jar &`
- **API testing:** `curl -X GET http://localhost:8083/api/books`

## Outstanding Items
### üö® Critical Issue: Logout Still Not Working
Despite implementing multiple fixes for the logout functionality, the user reports it's still not working. This remains the primary outstanding issue requiring investigation.

**Attempted Solutions:**
- ‚úÖ Enhanced event listeners with capture phase
- ‚úÖ Added keyboard shortcuts
- ‚úÖ Implemented forceFixLogoutButtons() method
- ‚úÖ Added debug utilities
- ‚ùå Issue persists - logout not functioning

### Completed Issues:
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting working exactly per specifications
- ‚úÖ Book listing page loading and displaying books correctly
- ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and user feedback throughout
- ‚úÖ Book cover images implemented in DataInitializer

## Next Steps
1. **Priority 1:** Debug and resolve the logout functionality issue
2. **Priority 2:** Test book image display in frontend
3. **Priority 3:** Verify all rate limiting scenarios work as expected
4. **Priority 4:** Complete end-to-end testing of all features

**Session Status**: üü° Major Progress with Logout Issue  
**Blocking Issues**: üî¥ Logout Functionality Not Working  
**Ready for Production**: üü° After Logout Fix
